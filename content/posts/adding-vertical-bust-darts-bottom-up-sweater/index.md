If your full bust and upper bust circumference have a difference of 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more, you may want to add bust darts to your sweaters. This will help you achieve a sweater that fits nicely in the shoulders and arms without sacrificing room for the bust.

There are two main types of bust darts in handknitting: vertical bust darts (VBDs) and horizontal bust darts (HBDs). The main differences are:
- Vertical bust darts add **width**. They’re typically worked as *increases and decreases*.
- Horizontal bust darts add **length**. They’re typically worked as *short rows*.

In this tutorial, I’ll demonstrate how to implement **vertical bust darts** in a **bottom-up sweater**. The same principles apply to top-down, but the instructions will be in reverse.

# Before you begin
To add vertical bust darts to a pattern, you'll need to know:
- Full bust circumference
- Upper bust circumference (measure under your arms with your arms down)
- Total stitch count for the body of your sweater
- Length of the garment from the hem to underarm

It's also nice to know:
- Length from the hem to bust apex

But if you don't know this measurement, refer to the guidelines below.

## General fit guidelines
**Note:** These can be adjusted for custom fit.
- Begin bust shaping 4" below the start of the underarm.
    - [Connie Hester](http://www.conniehester.com/knitting-bust-darts.htm) recommends splitting these 4" up as follows: 3" for shaping, 1" for straight knitting (no shaping).
- Add shaping 1/4 of the way into the front on both sides.
- Follow these guidelines for determining ease:
    - Snug fit: 0"-1"
    - Average fit: 1"-2"
    - Loose fit: 2"-3"

## Example measurements 
Here are the measurements used in this tutorial as an example:
| Example measurements |
|-----|
|Upper bust = 32"|
|Full bust = 34"|
|Length of the garment from hem to underarm = 15”|
|Total stitches for body = 204 stitches|

| Example stitch/row gauge |
|-----|
|Stitch gauge = 6 stitches/inch|
|Row gauge = 8 rows/inch|

## Choosing a sweater size
In this example, we want a sweater size equal to our **upper bust** + **2” of ease** for an average fit:

`Upper bust + X ease = Finished upper bust`

`32 + 2 = 34`

Based on this calculation, we’ll choose the sweater size that makes a 34” bust. (Make sure to choose the size that produces a circumference of 34”, not a size recommended for a 34” bust with `X` amount of ease built in already.)

We want to apply the same amount of ease to our full bust (2”):

`Full bust + X ease = Finished full bust`

`34 + 2 = 36`

**So, our finished sweater will have a 34” circumference with a full bust of 36”.**

# Adding vertical bust darts
**Note:** All measurements have ease added in.

## Step 1: Calculate your full and upper bust difference
1. Subtract your upper bust from your full bust to get the difference.  
    
    `Full bust - Upper bust = Difference between full and upper bust`  

    `36 - 34 = 2`

------------------------------------

## Step 2: Calculate your stitch and row counts
1. If knitting in-the-round, divide the total body stitches in half to get the front stitches. 


    `Total body stitches / 2 = Front stitches`  

    `204 / 2 = 102`

    Mark these stitches in your knitting to differentiate between back and front.

2. Multiply your stitch gauge by your full and upper bust difference to get the amount of stitches you need to increase.

    `Stitch gauge * Full and upper bust difference = Total increase stitches`  

    `6 * 2 = 12`

3. Add the increase stitches to the front stitches to get the bust dart stitches.

    `Increase stitches + Front stitches = Bust dart stitches`

    `12 + 102 = 114`

    At this point, we know:
    - We start with 102 stitches
    - We need to increase by 12 stitches 
    - Which will give us the stitch count of 114.

    Following the general guidelines, we know we want to increase these 12 stitches over 3” of fabric. Next, we need to calculate how many rows is 3” in our row gauge. Be sure to change this number if you're modifying the shaping.

4.  Multiply your row gauge by the length of dart shaping.

    `Row gauge * Length of dart shaping = Total dart rows`

    `8 * 3 = 24`

------------------------------------

## Step 3: Calculate the rate of shaping

Next, we’ll use the following formula to calculate the rate of shaping:

```
Rate of shaping* = Total number of rows / Number of shaping rows
```
<sup>*rounded down to the nearest whole (even) number</sup>

The number of shaping rows is equal to the stitches you need to increase divided by 2.

In this example, the total number of rows is **24** and the number of shaping rows is **6**. 

1. Calculate the rate of shaping:

    `Total dart rows / Number of shaping rows = Number of rows to increase`

    `24 / 6 = 4`

    This calculation translated into pattern instructions would read:  
    *Increase 1 stitch at each side every 4 rows a total of 6 times.*

    If you knit this instruction, you’ll have increased 12 stitches evenly over 24 rows (or 3”). 

------------------------------------

## Step 4: Calculate where to increase
Now that you know how frequently you need to increase, you’ll need to figure out where to place those increases. Amy Herzog's guideline is to place bust darts 25% in from each side. The way this is distributed across the front of your sweater is as follows: ¼ | ½ | ¼.

{{< figure src="vbd-placement-example1.png" caption="Placement of darts at 25% from each side" width="300px" >}}

To calculate this:
1. Divide the front stitches in half, then divide in half again.

    `102 / 2 = 51`

    `51 / 2 = 25.5 (rounded down to 25)`

2. If you had to round down (as I did), you'll have 1 extra stitch leftover. Add this stitch to the center column of stitches. 

    In this example, you would **knit 25 stitches, place a marker, knit 52 stitches, place a marker, knit 25 stitches**. 
    
    On your increase rows, increase each time you reach a marker.

------------------------------------

 ## Step 5: Determine when to start the increases
As we've established, you’ll generally want to start your bust increases 4” below the underarm.

1. To calculate this, subtract 4” from the total hem-to-underarm length:

    `Hem-to-underarm length - 4 = Length before increases`

    `15 - 4 = 11`

In this example, you would work your sweater for 11”, then start your bust increases.

------------------------------------

## Step 6: Determine the increase method
You can choose whichever increase method you prefer. A common way to increase for bust darts in stockinette is using the M1 increase and slanting them towards the edge:

**Increase Row (RS):** Work to marker, M1R, work to next marker, M1L, work to end.

If you needed to work these increase rows on the wrong side, mirror the increases and purl them:

**Increase Row (WS):** Work to marker, M1LP, work to next marker, M1RP, work to end. 

------------------------------------

## Step 7: Knit straight for 1”

Once you’ve implemented all of your bust increases, knit straight (no increases) for 1”. This straight section will ease the transition between increasing and decreasing, so you don’t get a conical shape at the bust. It will also add the extra fabric needed to account for your full bust shape.

If you have a larger bust, you may want to knit straight for more than 1”. If you have a smaller bust, you may want to experiment with knitting .5”. But keep in mind that generally, 1” will work for most body types, even if it’s not an exact fit (handknit fabric is flexible!). Be sure to factor length into any modifications.

------------------------------------

## Step 8: Decrease the bust dart stitches
Once you’ve knit the bust darts, you’ll need to decrease those stitches back out. Generally, you can place these bust decreases in between the armhole and the neckline edge, in the same place as the increases.

{{< figure src="vbd-placement-example2.png" caption="Placement of dart decreases following increases" width="300px" >}}

You can work the decreases at the same rate or faster than you worked the increases, depending on how many stitches you need to decrease.

When determining the decrease placement, keep in mind the following components:

**Armhole shaping**  
The armhole shaping can’t be modified without changing other parts of the pattern. This means you can’t decrease your dart stitches along the armhole edge.

**Shoulder stitches**  
Your shoulder stitch count should remain the same as in the pattern, so make sure you don’t decrease these out.

**Neckline**  
In most cases, the neckline won’t conflict with your dart decreases. However, if you have a deep neckline and a lot of dart stitches to decrease, your decreases may interfere with the bind-off of your neckline. You have a few options here:
- Place the darts closer to the armhole to avoid the neckline.
- Make the rate of shaping faster so you finish the set before it interferes with the neckline.
- Place an additional set of darts a few inches away so you can decrease at a faster rate without distorting the fabric.
- Use the neckline to bind off the darts that interfere (your neckline will be wider in this case). For example, if you need to start binding off your neckline but you can’t decrease any more shoulder stitches, bind off `X` extra stitches in your neckline, where `X` is the number of dart stitches left to decrease.

# Finishing up
And that’s it! 

It may seem like a lot of steps, but I tried to break it down as much as possible so any skill level can follow along.

If you get stuck, remember: your goal is to add extra width starting from the bottom of your bust to the top of your bust. Once you've added that width, you'll need to decrease it out in an area that won't interfere with other parts of the pattern. Because handknit fabric is so forgiving, you don't need to stress about every single stitch. Just make sure you're generally creating the shape and fabric that you want.

Happy custom knitting!
